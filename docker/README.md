The [folder for slurm cluster](./slurm-docker-cluster) came from git clone 
from this remote Github [repository](https://github.com/giovtorres/slurm-docker-cluster). 

It was not included as a sub module because several files needed to modified.

One could make this folder  a sub module pointing to our own public fork. This fork should be in the control
of university th-n√ºrnberg however.
